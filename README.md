- 👋 Hi, I’m Lucan
- 👀 I’m interested in combing modern computational and analytical techniques with big data, to solve real-world problems by providing data-driven solutions, such as prediction and recommedation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development (Full Stack) and various real-world machine learning applications(Especially NLP and recommmedation systems).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data science and Full stack web development projects
